Cloning Sun Down Studio Landing Page: A Student's Experience
As a web development enthusiast, I recently took on the challenge of cloning the frontend landing page of Sun Down Studio. Inspired by its sleek design and seamless user experience, I meticulously recreated its layout, typography, and animations using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Despite encountering challenges like responsive design issues and browser compatibility quirks, I persevered and successfully unveiled my cloned version. This project was not just a coding exercise; it was a valuable learning experience that honed my frontend development skills and taught me the importance of attention to detail.
